                        <h2> Nijhum Island </h2> <br>
                        
                        <p>The Bay of Bengal is surrounded by the Meghna river in the north and west, and Nijhum Island is a small green land surrounded by beaches and sea sands in the south and east. This island is a green of Keora garden filled with innumerable breathing roots. Twice a day, the island is covered in white sand on one side and beach on the other side. Here in winter, a fair of thousands of birds, a sanctuary of wild dogs and snakes, herds of chitra deer run all day cutting the green grass of this forest. This is Nijhum island. The most interesting thing about Nijhum island is the Keora forest for miles and the Chitra deer hidden behind the leaves of that forest. The river flows through rows of keora trees, silently calling near, binding mankind to the magical Indrajan. From the ocean, the narrow canal cuts through the green chest and goes to the bottomless forest. It is a love poem of green and salt water that cannot be believed. It is as if a green carpet has been spread to the bottom of the sea. Under the clear water, green grass and fishes play at will. If you see it, you will want to jump and jump and collect paran. It is such a magical nature that gives a new lease of life to the urban hustler. Nijhum Island - Really Nijhum. Only once. outside of everything. There is no glitter of tourism, the flash of colorful lights or the loud noise of any mechanical vehicle. Nijhum - really quiet, silent. It is like a separate entity of nature. Which is nowhere else.</p>

            <h3>In the solitude of Nijhum Island</h3><br> <h6>November 3, 2020</h6><br>
            
            <p>Suddenly, at the beginning of January, the ghost pressed that I would go to Nijhum Island. What if I went to so many places in the country and did not go to the most popular tourist spot in my district? Anyway, I left for Nijhum Island at the end of January. My first launch journey. Go to Sadarghat and get on the launch and start the journey. Despite taking a cabin, I stayed on deck for a while to see what it was like to travel on deck. How many types of people, how many strange jobs. Shakib Khan's movie is playing on TV. The extra noise, the light, started shortly after my famous migraine. After taking the medicine, I slept in the cabin. Can't sleep After looking around for a while, the eyes slowly came. I set the alarm clock at five o'clock in the morning. Although he woke up long before five o'clock. I woke up and peeked out. Little by little the light came on. I saw that the launch was standing. After that I got down to the launch ghat, after that two CNG started the journey. <br><br> Both sides of the road are beautiful but the road is very bad, it was very jerky in CNG. While observing the beautiful scenery around, I reached a ghat. After reaching there, I crossed the river by boat. Then I went to that side and reached Nijhum Island again with CNG. After going to Nijhum Island, I first went to where I would camp. The forest department staff there had been told in advance to stay in tents for the night. They kept the tent. It was very nice to go around a bit and now we went for a walk in the forest. Go a little ahead by auto and get down from the auto on the side of the road and start the jungle safari. Walking in the quiet forest. A little later, a large tree stump is left behind to cross the canal. There is nothing left to walk on both sides. It is a battle for us urbanites to cross this river. Two local boys helped us a lot. I crossed that tree and looked inside the forest. The illusion of green eyes. </p>

                    I didn't see deer but I saw a lot of birds around. We wandered around a bit and then had lunch. After about 24 hours a heavy meal was eaten again. Also Kelam buffalo milk curd, very good, first time test. Now the journey by boat starts on Chowdhury Canal and Kaviraj Canal. As I was going inside the canal with a small boat in the Kabiraj canal, the roots and mud were on both sides of the river. I stepped on the mud of the river and entered the forest, but I did not see deer. This time, when I went to Chowdhury canal, I saw two deer sitting by the river. When he saw us coming, he started running. A run into the forest. After that, no matter how many times I entered the forest and searched, I could not see the deer. I went to the beach in the late afternoon. A cottonwood tree stands there as a witness of time. A little photography was done under that tree. After chatting with a local uncle for a while, I came to the camp. <br> <br> After coming to the camp and getting fresh, I looked around the market and had tea and breakfast. After that the barbeque started. Now sit next to the barbeque and talk, then spread the mat on the ground and eat the barbeque. After eating, I set out on an expedition to eat date juice, but I could not find a single person to sell the juice at night. I wandered outside until one in the morning and came to the tent and thought that I had never eaten raw date juice in my life. I fell asleep thinking. Woke up early the next morning. I woke up and climbed the watch tower and saw the whole island. Today we will be leaving, so after saying goodbye to everyone, it was decided that this time we will finish drinking juice by the time we go to the ghat. While going, I entered a house, there is no shortage of palm trees, juice bones are hanging on every tree, many big willow trees are holding willow trees, there are many other things to keep turkeys and chickens. I drank raw date juice for the first time when I went to that house. The juice has a slightly sour and sweet taste, I enjoyed it for the first time. After that, I bid farewell to the people of that house by giving them the price of palm juice.

                   <p>Now the journey starts with CNG on the bank of the river. It was decided that I would take the trawler. I sat on the trawler but the trawler does not leave. One by one people have risen. At one point the trawler tilted to one side under the pressure of extra people. Being very scared, we decided not to go in the trawler, we came to the other side of the river by speedboat and started the journey again using CNG. Hatiya came and had breakfast. After breakfast, I walked around a bit and got on the launch. Now, due to the launch at one in the afternoon, I could see the surroundings well. After that, as the launch slowly moved forward, I saw Manpura Island and various chars. <br><br> I was eating various food and snacks at the launch, green forest on one side and wind all around. The ride looked great. Once a boat full of hilsa came and crowded on the launch. All the hilsa was raised in the launch. How to sleep at night was thought about. We two girls in one cabin and two boys in another cabin, all the rest of the boys pitched a tent inside the launch outside the cabin and slept inside it. Early in the morning, the launch arrived and stopped at Sadar Ghat. Dawn bids farewell to everyone. On this tour, if you go from Dhaka to Nijhum Island, the most time is spent on the launch. We left home at 1.30 pm on Thursday, boarded the launch from Sadarghat at 4.00 pm. The launch left at five o'clock in the afternoon. The launch arrived at five o'clock in the morning the next day. From there, the CNG car did everything. When we reached Nijhum Island, it was 12 noon. The trip took 24 hours to and fro. The journey was not bad though. Nijhum island is much more beautiful with greenery all around and I did not see forest deer but when the forest department man kept a deer, I saw that deer again and again. Our own country is much more beautiful. It is our responsibility to protect the country, so do not throw the garbage anywhere, throw it in the designated place.</p>
