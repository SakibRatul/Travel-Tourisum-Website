                        <h2> Nafakhum Falls </h2> <br>
                        
                        <p>Nafakhum Falls (Nafakhum Waterfall) is located in Remakri Union of Thanchi Upazila of Bandarban District. It is termed as one of the largest waterfalls in Bangladesh in terms of water flow. Others call it the Niagara of Bengal. To see Nafakhum, you have to go to Remakri by boat on the Sangu river route from Thanchi Bazar. Remakri has a Marma settlement, Khum means waterfall in the Marma language. This indelible mystery of nature can be seen only after walking for about three hours from Remakri. The water of Remakri canal came to Nafakhum and went down about 25-30 feet and nature gave birth to this waterfall. Rainbows constantly play here in the light of the sun on the water vapor of the rapidly descending water. If you are an adventure lover and want to trek in Bandarban, or want to see the green play of Bandarban's gaheen, the life scenes of the tribals, the terrifying form of Sangu or the play of the cold rocky water in winter, then you should visit the indescribably beautiful springs at least once in your life. Adventure lovers flock to visit Nafakhum Falls throughout the year while traveling to Nafakhum. However, in monsoons, if the water flow of the Sangu river is above the danger level, permission is not given by the administration to go to Nafakhum. In winter, water is very less in Nafakhum. So the most ideal time is after monsoon and before winter (September – November). But whatever time you go, you will love the nature here. Nafakhum trip will be memorable in your life forever.

             <h3>Nafakhum Falls </h3><br> <h6>July 22, 2021</h6><br>
            
          <p>I heard that the Jhiri Path can be crossed on foot, but I was surprised that the Jhiri Path has become a river. Not on foot, we moved along the trail in the trawler. It was fun, it was the first experience in my life, this is the first time I have come to the mountains. I have to guide the poor person who comes to eat because he wants to guide me. On the way back, he was in a bad mood. But it cannot be said that I was not afraid. After the trawler journey, the trekking started. As soon as you step into the spring water, your feet get shivery. I picked up the bamboo kanchi in my hand knowing that the water was a little cloudy. Oh, but I can't swim. I say in my mind, Bapu, be careful, he will die by drowning. In this way I walked with various thoughts and came to where I thought it was my Pulsirat, the rope tied on the other side of the Jhiri. Looking back at the front of the rope, you can see the whirlwind of the snow stream. Holding that rope, I moved forward with the name of the creator. As soon as I put my hands on the rope and move forward, I feel that I am not afraid anymore! You can ask where I am going. Going to Nafakhum, came last night. All the way very well, I fell in the rain and came to Thanchi. However, the tension of mountains and waterfalls is said. I clicked on the troller saying that I gave you the cloudy sky and rain all day. I said to myself that there is nothing to fear, he must die, that night we were remakri. The next day the rain did not stop. At last I braved the rain and took the road to Nafakhum.</p>

                 <p>I am very afraid of the leech, that's why it seems that the leech was not near me. But two of our group were bitten by the joke. I was never overly cautious. I got off the trawler and proceeded to Nirbhava. I was moving forward through the muddy deep forest with bamboo sticks. Sometimes I used to cross uphill by hugging tree branches. After an hour and a half tiring journey like this, I came in front of the rope or rope that I thought was Pulsirat, and I fell into deep thought for some time. Finally I dared to cross that rope. After walking like this for another hour, a loud roar is heard. It was still raining so there was no way to run. For we had no choice but to trudge up a tiresome ascent, sometimes over rocks and sometimes over slippery muddy paths. Yet we walk on. This is how the stream of Nafakhum Falls comes into view. He didn't want to move his eyes any further. Everyone was disorientated by the roar of the waterfall, and there was also a warning. Because it was not cloudy but it was still raining. And it was not possible to run over the rocks. However, we move forward quickly, then forget about returning, forget about getting the mobile phone or camera wet in the rain. Forgetting these things, I took pictures and continued to see Nafakhum's water stream with fascinated eyes. Meanwhile, the speed of rain was increasing and the water of Remakri Jhiri was also swelling. Say goodbye to Nafakhum after chasing the guide and take the way back

                   <p>How to go to Bandarban by direct bus from Dhaka. Dhaka Bandarban Bus Fare Non AC 660 Tk. By bus from Bandarban or if the group is heavy, then by Chander car. If the group is small, you can go by bus. However, the bus takes a lot of time. Bus fare is Tk 200 per person. Chander car or jeep rental reserve is like 4000 to 5000 rupees. Thanchi stayed overnight or came to Tindu on the same day by trawler. After reaching Remakri, Nafakhum left early the next morning. Spend the whole day there and return after noon. Carry enough water and dry food on the way to Nafakhum. Carry a life jacket. Don't do anything to destroy the environment and don't throw any non-decomposable things in the forest or around the waterfalls and in the Remakri Canal! </p>
