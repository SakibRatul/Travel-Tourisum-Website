                        <p>Gulyakhali beach in Sitakunda upazila of Chittagong. Sitakunda means ocean on one side and mountains on the other. Guliyakhali Sea Beach is 5 km from Sitakunda Bazar. This beach is known as “Muradpur Sea Beach” by locals. One of the characteristics of Gulikhali is that the entire seashore is covered with green grass like a carpet! Small mangrove forests adorn the three sides of the beach. And on the other side is the infinite ocean. Keora is one of the different species of forest plants. Breathtaking roots of mangrove forests spread across the beach. Many small and big canals flow through it. Canals fill with water during high tide. Gulyakhali Beach is a bit less known and is not visited by tourists most of the time. So you can enjoy the silence with the sea breeze to your heart's content. Shunshan Beach is also safe as there is a fishing village near Guliyakhali Sea Beach. Gulyakhali beach is near Banshbaria beach.</p>

            <h3>Sitakunda Ecopark and Guliyakhali Beach
            </h3><br> <h6>june 22, 2022</h6><br>
            
         <p>I left home in the evening with a bag on my shoulder. Even though the evening is starting to fall around me, I am excited like the light of dawn. I went straight to Mirpur with my bike in high spirits. From there, Shahbagh came with his teammate and saw two high school students standing there, there were also several people. And yes, my trip was with a tour group. Everyone was given a seat. There was a shortage of seats due to one person being more. What else to do! Finally, this thin, small man's place is in the extra seat next to the driver. That's the fun of instant travel. Adapting to where it is. At 11 pm our car started moving towards Chittagong. <br> <br> Everyone got to know each other in no time. Stories, laughter, jokes, music chats. Play-lists began to change over time. Soft Melody from Folk. It is raining little by little. The driver is driving very efficiently. The man next to me is looking at the map. One by one everyone in the team fell asleep. Just the three of us watching the road and the rain with a soft melody. Oh what a great feeling! At some point, my eyes caught my eye. I was woken up by the call of my teammate around 3 am. We stopped at one place for a while. Some are drinking tea, some are drinking coffee. A little separated from the people, I caught a cigarette. It is at this time at night that the calculation of the whole day can be done quietly. After the break, I left again. The morning light has begun to shine. We went down to Sitakunda local market to have breakfast. After breakfast is ready, everyone is freshened up and watching the dawn, with the white air of the morning. Now cut the gray light and light yellow light around. After breakfast, we got back in the car and went to Sitakund Ecopark. 35 km from Chittagong city. Sitakunda Ecopark is located on the eastern side of the Dhaka-Chittagong highway in the north. We are going to see Suptadhara Jharna The distance of Sahasradhara from the main gate of Ecopark is 5 km. As we are about to leave, everyone is very excited. Now it's time to get out of the car and walk.</p>

                <p>There are 487 stairs to descend from the top to Sahasradhara Jharna Straight continuous stairs, no ramps. As difficult as it is to go down this ladder, it is more difficult to climb it. Joke's fear falls on him. Before getting down, some are applying oil to their feet, some are pouring salt water. Seeing everyone's arrangements, I was a little nervous! It did not seem like how many jokes there! After everyone's preparation, I started walking up the stairs. I found a jaba flower on the way. I am singing songs and getting down in khopay gethe. I feel very happy. At one time I heard the sound of water from a distance. Everyone was very excited then. Even though the sun is hot on the head, everyone is going down very fast Some people jumped into the water when they came to the fountain in the heat of thirst! I looked over the fountain. The sun's rays play hide and seek with the water. Even if you don't get water as expected, the water looks like a grain of gold. <br><br> Our team leader didn't let me down in the fountain. The rest are looting in the water. I am very angry with him. I sit beside him gritting my teeth in anger. He said that those who are losing more energy here cannot go to another fountain. Climbing up in wet clothes will make you gasp. Suptadhara Jharna is more beautiful. Get into it The most annoying thing about this trip was that some people were taking pictures continuously from the beginning of the trip, due to which everyone else had to stop at places. They are more interested in snapping pictures than enjoying themselves. After a few hours we are climbing the stairs again. It's quite difficult. I keep getting up. Not stopping anywhere. Stop and enjoy the fatigue. I was the first to climb up because of continuous climbing. <br><br> Every person's situation is like going down a fountain. Everyone is sitting and resting. After a couple of hours we left for another waterfall. I got a match with the words. Some people stayed in our car because they were tired. The distance between Sahasradhara and Suptadhara Jharna is 2 km. Sahasradhara Jharna originates from the water of Suptadhara Jharna. In the second phase, everyone is afraid of jokes. We started down the stairs of Suptadhara. 422 stairs of Suptadhara. This time I went down first. Then Jhiripath. In the meantime, the water rose as the rain fell It was difficult to cross this place. I crossed the leader's hand. The beginning of everything, that is, the experiment is being done with me! In the meantime, another group of girls started screaming in the stream. A few of us helped them to cross.</p>

                   <p>We are walking into the desired slumber. The water is pouring down the chest of the mountain with a huge roar. His form is wonderful! It didn't stop me anymore. We soaked in cold water. By this time, it seemed that the whole day's suffering was worth it. After getting wet for a while, I saw the sky getting cloudy. The water is getting cloudy. Any accident can happen at the fountain when the storm descends. We decided to leave from there. Now I am also tired of going back through the steep path and climbing the stairs Still getting up. Next to me another group is rising with me. Finally we got to the top. When I came upstairs, I saw that the one who had oiled his feet the most was the one who made the most jokes. Beyond that we went to the main gate of Ecopark and changed our dress. After lunch at local hotel we will leave for Gulyakhali beach. We wore several sarees. If you don't wear a saree in the sea, what's going on? However, I often wear sarees. Acquired an extraordinary ability to read sarees in public washrooms. The distance from Sitakunda Bazaar to Gulyakhali Sea Beach is only 5 km. Also known as 'Muradpur Beach' to the locals. Guliakhali Sea Beach has Digantjora Sea water on one side and Keora forest on the other side. Environments like mangroves and swamp forests are found here. We parked the car and hired a trawler to go to Gulyakhali beach. Here is the tide calculation. The sailor said that the tide will start after one or two hours, then the trawler will no longer run and we will have to walk in the muddy water. After getting off the trawler, I saw a carpet of green grass! After that, the waves are crashing on the shore. This is my first time to see the sea! Great satisfaction was at that time! But the time passed very quickly! The evening is going down. Meanwhile, the tide also started. Two or three almost pushed the trawler. We had dinner and left for Dhaka again.</p>
