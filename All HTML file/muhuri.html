                        <p>Muhuri Project (Muhuri Project) is the second largest irrigation project in Bangladesh which is the country's first wind power plant located in Sonagazi Upazila of Feni district. Muhuri project is also known as the largest fishing zone in the country. As a result, it has now become one of the tourist attractions and tourist centers of Bangladesh. The distance from Feni Sadar to Sonagazi Upazila is 20 km. And its distance from Sonagazi upazila is 20 km. That is, the total distance of Muhuri project from Feni Sadar is 40 km. Part of it also falls within Mirsarai Upazila of Chittagong district. In 2004, the Bangladesh Electricity Development Board set up four 225 kW power units, the country's first wind-powered power units, at a cost of about seven crore taka. The Feni river flows into the Bay of Bengal passing by the project area. To the south are vast fields and green belt of forest department. The combined flow of Feni River, Muhuri River and Kalidas Pahalia River is dammed to form a large water control structure with 40 bunds.</p>

            <h3>A day at Muhuri Project and Sonagazi Coast
            </h3><br> <h6>March 28, 2020</h6><br>
            
            <p>What is happening in Kamla society, time is very short. Wherever he goes and whatever he does, Sabedhan Sadher's off day also goes away. This is a wonderful place to visit in one day for Kamla Samaj, Feni's Muhuri project. The beginning is from Dhaka's TT neighborhood. Because almost all the buses of Feni depart from here. Although some leave from Uttara and Mirpur.<br><br> One Friday at seven in the morning I left home. The primary target is TT Para, because from there every 15 minutes non AC and every 1 hour AC buses leave for Feni. You have to go and buy the ticket. So you will get both good and bad sides of this system to fill. However, since it was Friday at seven in the morning, the passenger pressure was good, on the other hand, there were no empty seats in the bus. So even though I reached before 7 o'clock, I got the 8:30 AC bus. Bus fare is only 350 taka. I sat on the bus on time and the bus started running towards Feni. On the way, however, there is a break of 15 minutes at Comilla. When the clock was cut, 3 hours passed by sitting on the bus. Just then I reached Feni. Feni is a very small but organized city. If you run along that one road, you will get almost everything. Apart from Rajarjhi Dighi, there is not much to see in Feni town. So I freshened up, ate, prayed and went out again. This time the junction of Feni and Chittagong is running in the Muhuri project. It is located in Sonagazi Upazila of Feni, just 29 km away from Feni district town. Muhuri Project is the 2nd largest irrigation project in Bangladesh. Bangladesh's 1st wind power plant is located in this place. It has the largest fishing zone in the country. And yes, all this is around the currently discussed Feni river.</p>

           <h5>Muhuri Project </h5> <br>
           <p> Muhuri irrigation project started in 1977-78 financial year and construction work of this second largest irrigation project in Bangladesh was completed in 1985-86 financial year. A large water control structure with 40 bunds is constructed by constructing Adi Dam to divert the combined flow of Feni River, Muhuri River and Kalidas Pahalia River. Through this, Feni Sadar, Chagalnaya, Parashuram, Phulgazi, Sonagazi of Feni district and Mirsarai upazila of Chittagong district enjoy the benefits. The Muhuri Irrigation Scheme was constructed to reduce the occurrence of floods in these areas during the monsoon season and to provide additional irrigation facilities to Aman crops. Amazingly clear blue sky and the strong brilliance of the water coming out of the dam, the calm water lake on the other side. You can take a boat ride if you want. The natural beauty of the Muhuri project is surrounded by artificial water bodies surrounded by dams. There are forestry, fish sanctuaries, bird sanctuary. On either side of the embankment, the bottom is lined with cobblestones and the top is a neat bed of durba grass. Various species of ducks and about 50 species of birds in winter can be seen very close while boating in the waters of Muhuri river. And so you can put the name of Muhuri project on the list wherever you go in the coming winter. This Muhuri project area, is now recognized as the largest fishery zone in the country, revolutionizing fisheries. It is here that many well-known companies of the country have developed commercial fisheries projects.</p>

               <br>
                    <p>Bangladesh's first wind power plant is located in Lamchi village of Khwaja which is about 500 yards away from this Muhuri project. The Feni river flows into the Bay of Bengal passing by the project area. To the south are vast fields and green belts of forest department and in between Bangladesh's first wind power plant. 4 turbines with a capacity of 225 KW have been installed, with which a maximum power generation of 0.9 MW is possible. After visiting the Muhuri project in the afternoon, you can cool your stomach a bit in the nearby market on your way back. On reaching the city, you can take Star Line or Ena bus to Dhaka. You will reach Dhaka within 3-4 hours. And through this, you can make a short cut, a one-day jumps tour. Feni can be the best destination for a day tour for those who want to go back to Kamla Khata the next day after leaving in the morning and eating all day. How to go from Feni to Sonagazi upazila by bus. Then you can go to CNG from Sonagazi to Muhuri project. Local CNG fare is Tk 40 to 50 per person. Or you can go directly from Feni by hiring a CNG or car micro bus to Muhuri project. However, go on tours, go trekking, go where you want, how you want.</p>
