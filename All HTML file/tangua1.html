                        <p>Tanguare Haor (Tanguar Haor) is spread over an area of about 100 square kilometers in Sunamganj district. Only water and water as far as the eye can see. Many villages are submerged in it. Boats are the means of transportation from one house to another in monsoon. At one end of Haor are the mountains of Meghalaya, 30 small springs coming down from there and the blue sky on the horizon. The area of Tanguare Haor of seven thousand acres triples in monsoon. There are similar places to visit in Bangladesh anywhere else in South Asia. But there is nowhere else as diverse as Tangua Haor. So if a foreign tourist wants to know the name of the sightseeing place in Bangladesh, travel experts suggest the name of Tanguar Haor.</p>

            <h3>Diary of Tanguare Haor </h3><br> <h6>September 3, 2020</h6><br>
            
            <p>Actually sudden plans are always better. One day I suddenly saw that there was a three-day closure ahead of me to take classes at the university. I thought to visit somewhere these three days. Thinking of where to go, our plan is to visit Sunamganj Tanguare Haorg. From Feni, I first went to Dhaka, spent a beautiful day there at Chota Khalamni's house and boarded the bus to Sunamganj the next night. The bus dropped us at Sunamganj early in the morning. The time was October 2018. A little bit of winter mood, light fog around in the morning. After getting down from Sunamganj, I first went to Hotel Tangua Inn. Went there and had breakfast. After breakfast, I freshened up with a little water in my eyes and mouth. Now the journey starts from Laguna towards Tahirpur. On both sides of the road, once welcomed the red shapler bill, once welcomed the white shapler bill. Couldn't enjoy the beauty on either side of the road as the road was too bad. After a journey of about two hours, I reached Tangua Haor. Boats were already reserved there. When I'm going to board a boat, I see a person who looks familiar. He and I both went up to the man and were so surprised beyond words. He was our college teacher, a very beloved teacher. We read to him. He loved us both very much. He and other teachers of ours have come to visit Tangua Haor together. I never thought that I would come here so far from home and meet the teachers like this. He was very happy to see us, several pictures were taken. Then they went to their boat and we went to our boat. Now start the journey by boat.</p>

                <p>Slowly the water is turning blue and green as the boat moves towards the inlet. The green hills of Meghalaya on both sides. Blue water below. I had a solitary lunch of cooked duck meat with rice. The food seemed like nectar. Majhi Bhai has magic in his hand. I went to Teker Ghat after noon. It was like a worship was going on. I saw that puja, devi bisarjan. Looking from above, the blue green mountains of Meghalaya are beside. So beautiful, so beautiful our country!!! I was watching with full eyes. After taking photos around Teker Ghat, I came back to the boat in the evening. It was decided to stay on the boat at night. I play very early at night. By 9 o'clock in the night, I finished eating and drinking at Hotel Tangua Inn, and now I came and sat on the boat. Played Ludo for a while with tourmates. As the night grew colder. Once I went to the roof and looked at the sky and saw the sky full of stars and full moon. There is no sound around, we are some people in the boat right in the middle of the haor. The moon is as big as a plate in the sky, my beloved man is holding my hand, the moment seems to stop. Can a thousand people live for such a moment???!!!! He was very sleepy around eleven o'clock at night. I went to sleep on the boat at half past twelve. Woke up early in the morning. After waking up early in the morning, go to the hotel and have some fresh breakfast and start the journey by boat again. I went to Shimul Bagan first. As it was the month of October, I didn't get Shimul flowers but it was like a green ceremony around. It is the same as soothing the eyes. Eyes were green. I found a lamb and loved it very much. Now I wandered here for a while in the magical river. The magical river looked so beautiful from the top of the hill, blue and green water. There was a place on top of the hill which had a stone, on one side of the stone was written Bangladesh and on the other side was written India. It means India-Bangladesh zero point.</p>

                   <p>This hill is about 150 feet high next to Jadukata river of Sunamganj. Locals call this hill Barik hill. The border of Bangladesh and India is defined by the pillar located on this hill. India is on one side of this stone and Bangladesh is on the other side. When I was taking pictures by the side of India, my travel mates were jokingly saying, "Don't go anymore, you will be shot by the BGB." I was saying “One day follow me to India will give album”! I fulfilled that resolution exactly one year later in November 2019. I went there and took some pictures and finally came back to Tahirpur. After that, I returned to Sunamganj city through Laguna and returned to urban civilization by bus. The memory of these few days floating on the boat will be remembered for the whole life. Alhamdulillah, life is not bad at all. But what is bad is the beautiful Tanguare hour. But biryani packets, children's pampers, plastic bottles etc. float in the Haor water. Well we travel for peace of mind but can you say why we don't give peace to the environment??? Bidra It is our responsibility to keep clean the environment we visit, which gives us peace of mind. Why don't we keep the environment clean.</p>
